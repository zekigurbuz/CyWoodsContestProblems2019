18. Recruits (no good theme yet)
Program Name: Recruits.java		Input File: recruits.dat
A team is a group of at most 3 people. You are in charge of handling the people who are interested in joining teams. Given a list of raw data consisting of recruits and a team they want to be on, sort them into respective teams and print them out in a more friendly format. Team membership is given on a first come, first serve basis. If somebody wants to join a team that already has 3 people, they will not be able to join.
Input
The first line of input will contain a single integer n that indicates how many test cases to follow. The first line of each test case will be a single integer r that indicates the number of recruits that signed up. Each of the following lines consists of the recruit’s name, and, if the recruit has a preferred team, then a dash -, followed by their preferred team’s name. If a recruit does not have a preferred team, they will be placed with other team-less recruits and recruits who could not get into their preferred team. 
Output
Output each team’s name followed by the members of the team, both in alphabetical order (case-sensitive). Any recruits without a team will be placed a team named Untitled Team X, where X is a number that starts at 1 and increments for each untitled team that is created. The untitled teams will be sorted together with the titled teams in alphabetical order. Separate each team with a newline, and separate each test case with ----- (5 dashes).
